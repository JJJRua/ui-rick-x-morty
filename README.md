Having Fun using react hooks in my free time and also I don't want  my fingers to forget write in react because I almost forgot some Angular code and concepts :(.

##### Current thought 
In my current job's project we are still using Class/Function Components and we are not allowed to update project dependencies (the project isn't big) without architecture team approval.
##### Reasons 
- we can break something (but that is the reason why we have environments)
- these new features and additions might be hard to understand for new Developers (xd)

Run the project using
### `yarn start`
I will add more features but in the meantime these are taks come to my mind
## TODOS 
- Add Redux React hooks
- Add Tests (100% Coverage)
- Create backend in Go (For a future integration I want to do )
