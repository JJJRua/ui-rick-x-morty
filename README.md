Having Fun using react hooks in my free time and also I don't want  my fingers to forget write in react because I almost forgot some Angular code and concepts :(.

Run the project using
### `yarn start`
I will retake this project and add some features
## TODOS Order By Priorities
- Add Graphql for API communication
- Add Tests (Testing-library)
- Implement Firebase
